                                    I built this website from a Photoshop PSD. Starting with a sketch of the HTML structure, document flow, links and text were added.
                                    Then I created the CSS file to make the website looked just like the PSD.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p id="right">
                                    This website can be improved further with responsive design, this way it will adapt to different screens. 
                                    Additional pages can be created to extend the menu options or a menu builder could be added.

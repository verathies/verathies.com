                            <p>Jubilee Austen is an aspiring web developer with experience in HTML5 and CSS. 
                                In her portfolio website you can learn a bit more about her journey into Tech and her passions. 
                                If you like her work, send her a quick message or follow her on social media. 
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="third-width">
                            <h2>Work method</h2>
                            <p>Images and icons were extracted from the Photoshop design comp. Once I noted down all the information about
                                colors and fonts, I started writing the HTML code. After some fun time with CSS, 
                                the website looks just like the original design!

                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="third-width">
                            <h2>Future ideas</h2>
                            <p id="right">
                                As a one-page portfolio it's quite complete but further sections about her work or a section with a traditional CV can be added. 
                                Responsive design will help to adapt the website to any screen-size.
